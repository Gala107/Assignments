                Simple Simon met a pieman,
            </span> <br>
            Going to the fair,<br>
            Says Simple Simon to the pieman,<br>
            Let me taste your ware. <br>
            Said the pieman unto Simon, <br>
            Show me first your penny; <br>
            Says Simple Simon to the pieman, <br>
            Indeed I have not any.<br>
            Simple Simon went a-fishing,<br>
            For to catch a whale;<br>
            All the water he had got, <br>
            Was in his mother's pail. <br>
            Simple Simon went to look <br>
            If plums grew on a thistle; <br>
            He pricked his fingers very much, <br>
            Which made poor Simon whistle. <br>
            He went for water in a sieve <br>
            But soon it all fell through <br>
            And now poor Simple Simon <br>
            Bids you all adieu!
